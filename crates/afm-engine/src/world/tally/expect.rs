//! Rush yards over expected and yards after the catch over expected (Data
//! overhaul items 5 and 6). Next Gen Stats fit both on the NFL's own plays;
//! these are fitted on the match engine's own plays at each level, as the
//! expected-completion model behind CPOE is (`game::stats::XCOMP`), so a
//! level's average back and receiver sit near zero. Refit after engine
//! changes that move runs or the catch and run:
//! `cargo run --release --bin xyards_fit -- 600`.
//!
//! The engine keeps no defenders' positions at the handoff or the catch, so
//! each model reads what the play record keeps: for a designed run, the
//! men in the box, inside or outside, how much field is left and the
//! distance to go; for a catch, how deep it was thrown, the receiver's
//! separation, man or zone coverage and whether he caught it in the middle
//! of the field. Least squares on the engine's plays at each level.
//! Proposed, not confirmed: the features.
